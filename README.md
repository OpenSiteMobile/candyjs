MobileSiteOS adaptation of Candy Chat chatting script

This is a test page repository for our adapted version of the Candy Chat (http://candy-chat.github.io/candy/) client side Javascript chatting script. The script communicates with an XMPP (Jabber) server using HTTP bindings. Our particular code and demo page is being used with OpenFire, an open source software based XMPP server. While our code should work with any XMPP server, your mileage may differ. Please note: our Candy Chat derived scripts are still under development and are not as yet fully functional (still working on the UI).
